Project for Dialogue System's course

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:


You control the character around the mansion with your voice.

Use utterances such as: open the door, open the chest, go to the left, look around, give me some help, give me a hint, etc.

Use "go back" to go to a previous section.

If something doesn't work, try formulating it differently.
