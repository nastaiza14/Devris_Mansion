I am conscious of the possible flaws of the mechanics and the possible mistakes there might be in the game, specially in the first floor. 
However, there is a considerable amount of work put into the game. 
The smoothest experience might be around the second floor in the library.
That being said, I had a lot of fun and learned a great deal with this exercise.

Improvements to be made in the intent/entity detection, the user interface and the implementation of sounds.

The presentation is in this folder in the form of a movie.
